# Finding-Undervalued-Companies

Using fundamental data of Stocks and Nearest Neighbors, we can identify which stocks are closely related with other similar stocks. This strategy can be used to quantitatively identify a stock's competitors and how it's price/fundamentals differ from them. If a company identified has same/better fundamentals but much lower valuation, a research is warranted into that stock.

This is still work-in-progress and can be refined further.
